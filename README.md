# House-Price-Prediction-in-Islamabad

This project aims to predict house prices in Islamabad using the dataset of zameen.com. We apply data science techniques to preprocess the data and then use different machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for house prices.

The project includes an ipynb file that details the preprocessing steps we have taken to clean and transform the dataset. We have removed null values, handled categorical variables, and normalized the data to ensure that it is suitable for building a predictive model.

We then use four different machine learning algorithms to predict house prices: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. These algorithms are popular choices for regression tasks and are well-suited to handling datasets with a large number of features.

Our results show that Random Forest is the best algorithm for predicting house prices in Islamabad, with an accuracy of 90%. This algorithm uses a combination of decision trees to create an ensemble model that provides more accurate predictions than any individual tree.

The project is available on GitHub, and anyone can access and download the code to replicate the analysis or use it for their own purposes. The project provides a comprehensive overview of the data science process, from data cleaning to model building, and is a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about machine learning and predictive modeling.
